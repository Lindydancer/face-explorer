;; Library and tools for faces and text properties.
;;
;; This library is useful for packages that convert syntax highlighted
;; buffers to other formats.  The functions can be used to determine
;; how a face or a face text property looks, in terms of primitive
;; face attributes (e.g. foreground and background colors).  Two sets
;; of functions are provided, one for existing frames and one for
;; fictitious displays, like 8 color tty.
;;
;; In addition, the following tools are provided:
;;
;; - `face-explorer-list-faces' -- list all available faces.  Like
;;   `list-faces-display' but with information on how a face is
;;   defined.  In addition, a sample for the selected frame and for a
;;   fictitious display is shown.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-describe-face' -- Print detailed information on
;;   how a face is defined, and list all underlying definitions.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-describe-face-prop' -- Describe the `face' text
;;   property at the point in terms of primitive face attributes.
;;   Also show how it would look on a fictitious display.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-list-display-features' -- Show which features a
;;   display supports.  Most graphical displays support all, or most,
;;   features.  However, many tty:s don't support, for example,
;;   strike-through.  Using specially constructed faces, the resulting
;;   buffer will render differently in different displays, e.g. a
;;   graphical frame and a tty connected using `emacsclient -nw'.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-list-face-prop-examples' -- Show a buffer with an
;;   assortment of `face' text properties.  A sample text is shown in
;;   four variants: Native, a manually maintained reference vector,
;;   the result of `face-explorer-face-prop-attributes' and
;;   `face-explorer-face-prop-attributes-for-fictitious-display'.  Any
;;   package that convert a buffer to another format (like HTML, ANSI,
;;   or LaTeX) could use this buffer to ensure that everything work as
;;   intended.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-list-overlay-examples' -- Show a buffer with a
;;   number of examples of overlays, some are mixed with `face' text
;;   properties.  Any package that convert a buffer to another format
;;   (like HTML, ANSI, or LaTeX) could use this buffer to ensure that
;;   everything work as intended.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-tooltip-mode' -- Minor mode that shows tooltips
;;   containing text properties and overlays at the mouse pointer.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-simulate-display-mode' -- Minor mode for make a
;;   buffer look like it would on a fictitious display.  Using this
;;   you can, for example, see how a theme would look in using dark or
;;   light background, a 8 color tty, or on a grayscale graphical
;;   monitor.

;; Fictitious displays:
;;
;; Emacs supports a variety of displays, from graphical frames to
;; terminals with 8 colors.  Emacs itself provides query functions for
;; existing displays.  This library provides query functions for any
;; kind of display, allowing you to play the "what if" game.  (For
;; example, how would a face look on a grayscale graphical display or
;; an 8 color tty.)
;;
;; It is possible to use the query functions for fictitious displays
;; in batch mode, when the normal face and colors system are severely
;; restricted.

;; Library functions:
;;
;; Function for existing frames:
;;
;; - `face-explorer-face-attributes' -- The face attributes
;;   of a face, after expanding all inherited faces.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-face-prop-attributes' -- The primitive face
;;   attributes of a face specification, as used by the `face' text
;;   property.  Effectively, this can tell how a piece of text look to
;;   the user, expressed in terms of foreground color, background
;;   color, underline etc.  Face remappings performed by
;;   `face-remapping-alist' are handled.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-face-attributes-at' -- The primitive face
;;   attributes at a specific position in a buffer.
;;
;; Support for a fictitious display:
;;
;; The following variables defines a fictitious display.  The
;; face-explorer tools use the global variants of these variables.
;; However, when calling the functions in the library, it's possible
;; to dynamically bind them using `let'.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-number-of-colors' -- Number of colors.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-background-mode' -- The background mode, either
;;   `light' or `dark'.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-color-class' -- The color class: `color',
;;   `grayscale', or `mono'.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-window-system-type' -- The window system type,
;;   either a symbol like `tty' or a list like `(graphic ns)'.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-match-supports-function' -- A function to call to
;;   determine the features a display supports.  By default, a
;;   graphical display supports everything and a tty supports things
;;   like underline and inverse video.
;;
;; The following functions can be used to query face-related
;; information for fictitious displays:
;;
;; - `face-explorer-face-attributes-for-fictitious-display'
;;   -- The face attributes of a face, after expanding all inherited
;;   faces, for a fictitious display.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-face-prop-attributes-for-fictitious-display' --
;;   The primitive face attributes of a face specification, as used by
;;   the `face' text property, for a fictitious display.  Effectively,
;;   this can tell how a piece of text look to the user, expressed in
;;   terms of foreground color, background color, underline etc.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-face-attributes-for-fictitious-display-at' -- The
;;   primitive face attributes at a specific position in a buffer, for
;;   a fictitious display.

;; Face-related tools:
;;
;; This package provide a number of face-related tools.  Most of them
;; display information about a face both in the selected frame and as
;; it would look on a fictitious display.
;;
;; Key bindings:
;;
;; In the tool buffers, you can use the following keys to change the
;; settings:
;;
;; - `-', `+', and `#' -- Decrease, increase, and set the number of
;;   colors of the fictitious display.  The increase and decrease
;;   commands use 8, 16, 256, and "infinite" colors.
;;
;; - `b' -- Toggle between light and dark background mode.
;;
;; - `c' -- Step to the next color class.
;;
;; - `r' -- Reset the fictitious display to match the selected frame.
;;
;; - `g' -- Toggle the window system between that of the selected frame
;;   and a terminal.

;; Face verifiers:
;;
;; The `face-explorer-list-faces' and `face-explorer-describe-face'
;; tools warn about inappropriately defined faces.  You can use the
;; following keys to handle these warnings:
;;
;;    - `wd' -- Disable verifier
;;
;;    - `we' -- Enable verifier
;;
;;    - `wa' -- Enable all verifiers
;;
;;    - `wn' -- Disable all verifiers
;;
;;    - `wx' -- Describe verifier.

;; The `face-explorer-list-faces' tool:
;;
;; List all available faces.  Like `list-faces-display' but with
;; information on how a face is defined.  In addition, a sample for
;; the both the selected frame and for the current fictitious display
;; is shown.
;;
;; Additional keys:
;;
;; - `RET' -- Open the `face-explorer-describe-face' tool for the face
;;   on the line of the cursor.

;; The `face-explorer-describe-face' tool:
;;
;; Display information about a face.  This includes:
;;
;; - The documentation
;;
;; - The face attributes in the selected frame
;;
;; - Ditto, but with inheritances resolved
;;
;; - Primitive face attributes and samples for the current fictitious display
;;
;; - Samples for a number of typical fictitious displays
;;
;; - The face specifications used to define the face, originating from
;;   `defface', `custom-theme-set-faces' etc.

;; The `face-explorer-describe-face-prop' tool:
;;
;; Display information about a `face' text property.  This includes:
;;
;; - The value of the property
;;
;; - The corresponding primitive face attributes in the selected frame,
;;   with samples.
;;
;; - Ditto for the current fictitious display
;;
;; - Samples how the `face' text property would look in a number of
;;   typical fictitious displays.

;; The `face-explorer-list-display-features' tool:
;;
;; Display a buffer contains text using specially constructed faces
;; that will look differently depending on available display features.
;; For example, if you run `emacsclient -nw' from a terminal, this
;; buffer will look differently than it does in a graphical frame.

;; The `face-explorer-list-face-prop-examples' tool:
;;
;; List sample text with face text properties in various variants.
;;
;; This is useful for two reasons:
;;
;; - It can be used to investigate how Emacs, rally, displays various
;;   faces and text properties.
;;
;; - It can be used to test packages that convert text with text
;;   properties to various other format, like PostScript, HTML, ANSI,
;;   LaTeX etc.

;; The `face-explorer-list-overlay-examples' tool:
;;
;; List sample text with overlays in various variants.

;; The `face-explorer-tooltip-mode' tool:
;;
;; A minor mode that shows information about text
;; properties and overlays in a tooltip.
;;
;; This is enabled in all buffers displayed by the tools in this
;; module.
;;
;; `face-explorer-tooltip-global-mode' can be used to enable this mode
;; for all buffers.

;; The `face-explorer-simulate-display-mode' tool:
;;
;; A minor mode used to show how the current buffer would look in a
;; fictitious display.  This can be used, for example, to check if a
;; face theme would look good in a 8 color tty or in a grayscale
;; graphical display.
;;
;; The key bindings describe above above are available after the
;; prefix `C-c !'.
;;
;; Note: The mode will not restrict colors to the fictitious display.
;; For example, if a face is defined as "red" it will be shown in red
;; even when the fictitious display is set to `mono' or `grayscale'.
;;
;; `face-explorer-simulate-display-global-mode' can be used to enable
;; this mode for all buffers.

;; Vocabulary:
;;
;; Primitive face attributes:
;;
;; Normally, a face or face specification can be quite complex, for
;; example a face can inherit from other faces and a face
;; specification can contain several faces.  "Primitive face
;; attributes" corresponds to how the face or face specification will
;; look to the user, the foreground and background color it has,
;; whether it is bold or italic etc.  Unspecified properties are not
;; included.  Properties like :height could be relative (like 1.2) or
;; absolute (like 10).  Primitive face attributes never contain the
;; `:inherit' attribute.

;; Technical background:
;;
;; Face definitions:
;;
;; The attributes associated with a face can originate from the
;; following locations:
;;
;; - `defface' -- This construct defines a customizable face.  The
;;   information is stored in the property `face-default-spec' in the
;;   face symbol.  Normally it is accessed using the function
;;   `face-default-spec'.
;;
;; - Customize -- A user can customize a face using
;;   `custom-theme-set-faces'.  The `theme-face' property of the face
;;   symbol contains an alist from active themes to display
;;   requirements face specifications.
;;
;; - Overrides -- Face attributes can be overridden using the function
;;   `face-spec-set'.  This information is stored in the
;;   `face-override-spec' property in the face symbol.
;;
;; - Future frames -- The function `set-face-attribute' can specify
;;   that an attribute should be set for future frames, by passing nil
;;   or `t' as FRAME.  This information can be accessed using
;;   `face-attribute' by passing `t' as the FRAME.
;;
;; - Existing frames -- A face attribute can be changed in existing
;;   frames by `set-face-attribute' by passing a frame or nil as
;;   FRAME.  This information can be accessed using `face-attribute'.
;;
;; Face aliases:
;;
;; The `face-alias' property of the face symbol can contain another
;; symbol which the face is aliased to.
;;
;; Distant foreground:
;;
;; A "distant foreground" is an alternative color used to render the
;; foreground when the normal foreground color would be too close to
;; the background.  Unfortunately, there is no clear definition of
;; what "too close" really means, so it is hard to simulate it.
;; Currently, this package return both the `:foreground' and
;; `:distant-foreground' attributes.  Hopefully, in the future, it
;; might be possible to deduce the color that is shown and use
;; `:foreground' to represent that color.

;; Other Font Lock Tools:
;;
;; This package is part of a suite of font-lock tools.  The other
;; tools in the suite are:
;;
;;
;; Font Lock Studio:
;;
;; Interactive debugger for font-lock keywords (Emacs syntax
;; highlighting rules).
;;
;; Font Lock Studio lets you *single-step* Font Lock keywords --
;; matchers, highlights, and anchored rules, so that you can see what
;; happens when a buffer is fontified.  You can set *breakpoints* on
;; or inside rules and *run* until one has been hit.  When inside a
;; rule, matches are *visualized* using a palette of background
;; colors.  The *explainer* can describe a rule in plain-text English.
;; Tight integration with *Edebug* allows you to step into Lisp
;; expressions that are part of the Font Lock keywords.
;;
;;
;; Font Lock Profiler:
;;
;; A profiler for font-lock keywords.  This package measures time and
;; counts the number of times each part of a font-lock keyword is
;; used.  For matchers, it counts the total number and the number of
;; successful matches.
;;
;; The result is presented in table that can be sorted by count or
;; time.  The table can be expanded to include each part of the
;; font-lock keyword.
;;
;; In addition, this package can generate a log of all font-lock
;; events.  This can be used to verify font-lock implementations,
;; concretely, this is used for back-to-back tests of the real
;; font-lock engine and Font Lock Studio, an interactive debugger for
;; font-lock keywords.
;;
;;
;; Highlight Refontification:
;;
;; Minor mode that visualizes how font-lock refontifies a buffer.
;; This is useful when developing or debugging font-lock keywords,
;; especially for keywords that span multiple lines.
;;
;; The background of the buffer is painted in a rainbow of colors,
;; where each band in the rainbow represent a region of the buffer
;; that has been refontified.  When the buffer is modified, the
;; rainbow is updated.
;;
;;
;; Faceup:
;;
;; Emacs is capable of highlighting buffers based on language-specific
;; `font-lock' rules.  This package makes it possible to perform
;; regression test for packages that provide font-lock rules.
;;
;; The underlying idea is to convert text with highlights ("faces")
;; into a plain text representation using the Faceup markup
;; language.  This language is semi-human readable, for example:
;;
;;     «k:this» is a keyword
;;
;; By comparing the current highlight with a highlight performed with
;; stable versions of a package, it's possible to automatically find
;; problems that otherwise would have been hard to spot.
;;
;; This package is designed to be used in conjunction with Ert, the
;; standard Emacs regression test system.
;;
;; The Faceup markup language is a generic markup language, regression
;; testing is merely one way to use it.
;;
;;
;; Font Lock Regression Suite:
;;
;; A collection of example source files for a large number of
;; programming languages, with ERT tests to ensure that syntax
;; highlighting does not accidentally change.
;;
;; For each source file, font-lock reference files are provided for
;; various Emacs versions.  The reference files contains a plain-text
;; representation of source file with syntax highlighting, using the
;; format "faceup".
;;
;; Of course, the collection source file can be used for other kinds
;; of testing, not limited to font-lock regression testing.

;; History:
;;
;; Part of the code of this package was originally published as part
;; of the package `e2ansi', a package that can emit highlighted text
;; to a terminal using ANSI sequences.  `e2ansi' can be configured to
;; be used with the command line command `more' and `less' to syntax
;; highlight anything viewed using those command.

;;; Code:

;; References:
;;
;; - `defface': "For backward compatibility, elements of SPEC can be
;;   written as (DISPLAY ATTS) instead of (DISPLAY . ATTS)." However,
;;   in most cases, it looks like the former is used, at least for
;;   `custom-theme-set-faces', for all themes shipped with Emacs 25.
;;   Unfortunately, it affects how the property `theme-faces' look.
;;
;; - The two variables below are automatically applied to
;;   `get-text-property' (even though it's documentation doesn't
;;   mention this).
;;
;;   `char-property-alias-alist': Alist of alternative face properties
;;   (e.g. `((face font-lock-face))'.
;;
;;   `default-text-properties': Property list of default text
;;   properties (e.g. `(face (:underline t))').
;;
;;   WARNING: This is also active when getting accessing text
;;   properties of STRINGS, hence the return value will depend on the
;;   value if this variable in the buffer that happens to be current,
;;   unless these variables explicitly are let-bound.
;;
;; - `get-char-property' is returns the value of text properties or
;;   overlays.  However, it only returns the value of one text
;;   property/overlay, which makes it unsuitable for the `face'
;;   property, as Emacs joins all occurrences when displaying the
;;   result.  This package provide `face-explorer-face-text-props-at'
;;   that returns the combined value.
;;
;; - `next-single-property-change' finds the next text property change
;;   and `next-char-property-change' the same for text properties or
;;   overlays.  Note that they behave differently when the text
;;   property stretch to the end of the buffer, the former return
;;   `nil' whereas the latter `point-max'.
;;
;; - A "display requirement" is an alist of the form `((DISPLAY-REQ
;;   . (ATTR VALUE ...)  ...)'  which is the same as `((DISPLAY-REQ
;;   ATTR VALUE ...) ...)'.  DISPLAY-REQ is a form specifying
;;   conditions to match a display.  The first element may use
;;   `default' as DISPLAY-REQ, meaning that the attributes it
;;   specifies default values for the following elements.

;; Emacs bugs:
;;
;; The documentation of `defface' doesn't mention that `tty' is a
;; valid value for `type'.
;;
;; Manual specifies that all attributes of the `default' face should
;; be defined, but :distant-foreground isn't.
;;
;; When a face with a :distant-foreground is themed,
;; :distant-foreground is incorrectly retained.
;;
;; Re-evaluating a theme definition (?) hides it from `disable-theme'.

;; Bad faces:
;;
;; The following is a list of faces I've noticed contain a
;; questionable definition.  The list is by no means complete.
;;
;; - `font-lock-keyword-face' use "cyan" as foreground color in light
;;   displays in 8 color mode.
;;
;; - `font-lock-variable-name-face' use "yellow" as foreground color
;;   in light displays in 8 color mode.
